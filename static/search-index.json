      "content": "Project Overview This is a MIDI production focused DAW I built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I eventually evolved it with a bunch of node functionality to get around some CORS bullshit, as always. I have thousands of hours working with DAWs for audio production, so making something like this is comes pretty natural to me.

      "content": "Project Overview Web-based SP-1200 audio emulator that recreates the distinctive sound characteristics of the legendary E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler, which was iconic in hip-hop's golden era. Well not exactly the same because it's missing the iconic hardware, but very close, closer than any VST/bitcrusher can achieve as those just add noise and filters. The principal is still very sound. Sample at a faster RPM into the machine, slow it back down to original speed and your stuff is not o...",

It's a very diffcult game, think robotron but faster pace with projectiles and explosions. It has rougelike elements within the campaign, but full on build crafting for survival and sandbox modes. The build crafting is very deep, for example,you can make healing builds, spam rocket builds, dash based builds, glass cannon builds, augment how e...",
